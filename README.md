# Testing the API

To test the API:

1. Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to make HTTP requests.
2. Use the JWT token returned from the Login endpoint to authenticate requests that require authorization (such as creating blogs, assigning editors, etc.).
3. Refer to the API documentation above for the request formats and expected responses.

Deployment
Deploying Locally
Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service (like MongoDB Atlas) and set the MONGO_URI in your .env file accordingly.

Run the following command to start the server locally:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Deploying to Production

For production, you can deploy the API to platforms like:

- Heroku
- Vercel
- AWS (EC2, Lambda)
- DigitalOcean
  Ensure to set environment variables (like MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET) in the platformâ€™s environment settings.

> vercel

Add `vercel.json` file and copy this

```bash
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "/app.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

and then deploy in vercel
